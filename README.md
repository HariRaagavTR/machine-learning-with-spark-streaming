### ℹ️ About: 
This is the final project under the course of Big Data (UE19CS322) for 5th semester in PES University. <br>
<br>
### 🎯 Aim:
To simulate a real world scenario of handling enormous amount of data for predictive modelling.<br>
The data source is a stream and there is the constraint of handling batches of stream at any given point in time.<br>
<br>
### 📝 Objectives and Outcomes:
1. An in-depth understanding of how applications in real world work with large data streams.<br>
2. Analyze large data streams and process them for machine learning tasks using **Spark Streaming** and **Spark MLlib** to draw insights and deploy models for predictive tasks.<br>
3. Understand how applications in the real world modify their algorithms to work on large data streams and how incremental processing can be leveraged to process and analyze streams over time.<br>
<br>

### 💻 Softwares/Languages used:
1. Python 3.8.X
2. Hadoop 3.2.2
3. Spark 3.1.2
<br>
